# About aoc-chicken

[AOC](https://adventofcode.com/) is a fantastic developer challenge set each
year to solve various christmas related puzzles, in any chosen language.

aoc-chicken was born out of wanting to challenge myself to redo older AOC
challenges in scheme, and particular in [chicken scheme](https://www.call-cc.org/)

Previously I have been writing these challenges in [kotlin](https://kotlinlang.org/).
My kotlin repo is at [advent of code](https://github.com/markjfisher/advent-of-code).
